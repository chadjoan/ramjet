Cross D Compiler

A compiler aimed at making it easier to target miscellaneous platforms with the D programming language.  The plan is to create a C backend that can 
emit portable C code that can then be compiled on other platforms.  Eventually other targets could be added, like JVM bytecode, Javascript, or Flash 
bytecode.  In principle, creating a working port of D on other platforms should be as easy as setting a few configuration options and letting it rip.
