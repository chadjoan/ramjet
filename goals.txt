Goals/milestones for XDC:
- Demoable version that converts simple D code to C(++) code.
  - It should implement basic expressions/statements, variable declarations, function declarations, CTFE, string mixins.
  - Support int/float types.  MAYBE pointers.  No arrays needed (yet).
  - It must include one "WOW"ing feature, such as the ability to display the code being morphed step-by-step.
- Kickstarter page for XDC.
  - Features the demo.
  - Mentions any parsing libraries released in the process of making the demo.  (Why am I capable of delivering?)
  - Reviewed by D community and everyone likes it.
- Kickstart funding succeeds.
  - Need about $35000 for a year of work.  (Break it down for them; include income tax.)
  - If I asked for $40000 and only got $37000, I would want to take the $37000.
